    <p><em>Partner and co-producer of <strong>Viharefiore</strong> fashion and accesories E-store.</em></p>
    <p>Life long disciple of virtue, and truth. My acadmeic career was steeped in primary document readings, and lectures from leading figures in politics, academics, and ethics. I learned a great deal from my mentors and peers about politics and human nature, but most importantly I learned that history is written by the victors, and that victory is achieved by means of combining competency, morality, and action into virtuous deeds. Batman will take care of the cheaters.</p></td>
